## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm Jai Mehta â€” a Full-Stack Software Engineer passionate about building impactful products and scalable systems. I specialize in crafting clean, efficient solutions across the stack using technologies like **React.js**, **Node.js**, **Java/Spring Boot**, **Flask**, and **MongoDB**. I'm currently working at **Deutsche Bank** and building tools that make developersâ€™ lives easier, like [**NeatLeet**](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/neatleet/jcedgkkdknkjbmgbcpipnbdmoblilnmd), a Chrome extension that connects LeetCode problems to NeetCode solutions with a single click.

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on Chrome Extensions, Backend APIs, and Full-Stack Web Apps.
- ðŸŒ± Learning advanced **system design** and scaling distributed systems.
- ðŸ‘¯ Looking to collaborate on open-source tools that improve productivity or developer experience.
- ðŸ’¬ Ask me about anything software engineering, from **frontend architecture** to **backend APIs** to **LLD**.
- ðŸ“« Reach me at: [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/jai-anish-mehta/) or [jaimehta@cs.stonybrook.edu](mailto:jaimehta@cs.stonybrook.edu)
- âš¡ Fun fact: I built and deployed my first full-stack project *before* learning how to center a div in CSS.
